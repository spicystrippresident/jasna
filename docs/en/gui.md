# Using the GUI

A tour of the app — including the small features that are easy to miss.
Every setting has a tooltip: hover the ⓘ icon next to it.

## The queue

- Add videos or images with the **Add Files** button (the folder icon next
  to it adds a whole folder), or just **drag & drop** them onto the queue.
- **Reorder jobs by dragging** a queue item by its handle — processing runs
  top to bottom.
- Each queue item has its own buttons: the **scissors** opens the
  [Segment Editor](segments.md) to restore only parts of that video, and the
  cross removes it from the queue.
- While processing, each item shows live progress, FPS, and time remaining.
- **Stop** ends the run. The item you stopped goes back to **Pending**, so
  the next start processes it again from the beginning; the half-written
  output file is left on disk for you to delete.
- **Clear Done** removes finished jobs; **Clear** empties the queue.

## Output settings

- **Same as input** writes each result next to its original file. Turn it
  off to pick one output folder for everything.
- **Preserve input subfolder structure** records the root selected when a folder
  is added or dropped, then recreates each relative subfolder below the output
  folder. Individually added files still write directly to the output folder.
- The **filename pattern** controls output names — `{original}` stands for
  the input name. If a pattern would overwrite something, the affected queue
  items are highlighted immediately.
- **File conflict** decides what happens when the output file already
  exists: **Auto rename** (default, safe), **Overwrite**, or **Skip**.

## Presets

The bar at the top of the settings panel stores complete setting
combinations. Create a preset for each kind of content you process (for
example "1080p fast" and "4K best quality") and switch with one click. Jasna
remembers your last-used preset across restarts.

## Per-video settings

Detection model and confidence chosen in the [Segment Editor](segments.md)
are remembered **per queued video**, so different videos in one queue can use
different detection settings.

## Interactive image restoration

For still images, **Process images interactively** (in the SD 1.5 section)
opens a side-by-side view: step through your images, try different seeds,
compare the original, mask, and restored result, and save only the variants
you like. Much faster than re-running whole jobs when experimenting.

## System check

On the first launch of each version, Jasna runs a system check (GPU, driver,
memory, install path). You can re-run it any time from the header — useful
after a driver update or when something misbehaves.

## Other bits worth knowing

- **Language**: switch the interface language from the header dropdown
  (restart for the full effect).
- **Logs**: the Logs button in the bottom bar shows live logs with level
  filters and an export button — attach an export when reporting a problem.
- **System stats**: GPU, VRAM, RAM, and CPU usage are shown in the bottom
  bar while processing.
- **License**: enter your supporter key from the header; the chip shows
  whether it's active.
